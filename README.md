# Tanks JS Game

Small project to learn Phaser javascript game framework. Borrowing greatly from Phaser's tank example for images and basic code. Use of WebSockets was added (via socket.io) to communicate the location of the tank to all connected users. NodeJS and ExpressJS are used to serve the local HTML and Javascript files.
